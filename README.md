# Wholesale Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the application of unsupervised learning techniques on the Wholesale Data dataset to identify patterns and group similar data points. The main tasks include exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis.

## Summary of Findings
- **EDA**: Insights on data distribution, outliers, and correlations between variables.
- **Clustering**: Optimal number of clusters identified using the elbow method and hierarchical clustering.
- **PCA**: Principal components analyzed and visualized to understand the variance explained.

## Business Applications
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified customer segments can help in targeted marketing strategies.
- **Inventory Management**: Insights from clustering can optimize inventory levels based on customer purchasing patterns.
